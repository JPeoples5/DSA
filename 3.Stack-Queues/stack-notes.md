# Stack

- A LIFO data structure
- Last In First Out
- "Stacking paper the last paper is placed on top and will be removed from the top"

- The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

## Example:

Cmd+z undoing actions from a stack.

## Where stacks are used:

- Managing function invocations
- Undo / redo
- Routing the historyâ€¦ is treated like a stack
