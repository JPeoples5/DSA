What is a Tree:
- A data structure that consist of nodes in a parent / child relationship

How BSTS Work:

- Every parent node has at most two children.
- Every ndoe to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent  

Terminology:

List - linear 
Trees - nonlinear 
Leaf - node with no children
Edge - The connection between nodesâ€¦ displayed as arrows
Root Node - Top mode node. A tree can only have one root

Tree Examples:
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax trees
- AI
- FSO - File System Object 
- JSON

Why BSTS Are Useful;

- Every comparison cuts the data in half. 
- Fast lookups and insertion.
