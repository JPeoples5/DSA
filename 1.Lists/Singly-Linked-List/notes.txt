linked list are good at insertion and deletion because you don't have to reindex the whole array.

Singly linked list means only one node is connected to one other node.

in an array each item is mapped to its index
but a linked list consist of node and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
random acces is not allowed. You must start at the head and traverse until your at the tgt node.


Each element is a node.
a node store a piece of data (number or string etc)

a node also references the next node
