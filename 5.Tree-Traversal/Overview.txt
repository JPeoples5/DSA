Overview: In a super wide tree BFS will use more space as it needs to hold all the nodes in the queue.

If a tree is more tall than it is wide BFS might be the way to go as DFS will take up more space.

Trees are non-linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes

Binary Tree can have values of any type, but at most two children for each parent

Binary search trees are a more specific version of binary trees whre every node to the left of a parent is less than it's value and every node to the right is greater

we can search through Tree using BFS and DFS
